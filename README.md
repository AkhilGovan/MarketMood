# MarketMood â€” Real-Time Consumer Sentiment for Financial News

## Overview

**MarketMood** is a Chrome extension that overlays real-time consumer sentiment directly onto financial news articles and stock tickers as you browse.  
It bridges the gap between traditional financial reporting and the emotional drivers that increasingly move stock prices today.

## Why Sentiment Matters

> Tesla's recent earnings report missed Wall Street expectations â€” yet the stock **skyrocketed** after hours.  
> Traditional analysis predicted a fall, but *consumer sentiment* â€” driven by optimism and online buzz â€” overpowered fundamentals.  

This is no longer an isolated case: **sentiment is now a key market driver.**  
Despite this shift, **real-time sentiment insights remain invisible** across major finance platforms.  
Traders and investors must dig through forums, Twitter feeds, and dashboards â€” a fragmented, slow process that risks missing the moment.
